This vscode plugin provides Syntax Highlighting and IntelliSense for Tagged Template in [lupos.js](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.js) and  in [lupos.paint](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.paint).



## Features

For Lupos Template Literal, this plugin provides:

- HTML & CSS Highlighting and IntelliSense
- Auto Completion
- Quick Info
- Goto Definition
- Diagnostics
- Quick Fix for import missing



## Development and Debugging

Before running, call `npm run link` (only work in Windows) to link server part to `node_modules`.

If wanting to debug server part, please follow comments in `packages/lupos-server/src/core/logger.ts`.



## Not provided, but plan to

- `>${...}<` slot content completion. Now can only complete for object properties.
- Validate circular references. I believe this should be superior difficult.
- Validate tag not rightly matched or closed. e.g., `</div`.
- Can find reference and rename `<Com>` or `:binding`, properties and event names.
- Decorates a variable or property to describe whether it gets observed.
